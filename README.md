### Hi there, Xin ch√†o
I'm Glen (Rip) Merritt, PhD from the University of Alabama

I am passionate about and work in robotics and AI, together called embodied intelligence. 
I have worked with deep learning, Neural Net Control Systems, Cyberphysical Human Systems, Additive Manufacturing, and Sensor Fusion. 
(Please see publications and repositories)

I currently work as a mechanical engineer and product manager at Mujin Inc, advancing the capabilities of industrial robotics.

On the side, I see what LLMs are capable of and integrate them into my daily life and workflow.
